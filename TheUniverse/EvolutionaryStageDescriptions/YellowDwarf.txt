"A G-type main-sequence star (Spectral type: G-V), often called a yellow dwarf, or G dwarf star, is a main-sequence
star (luminosity class V) of spectral type G. Such a star has about 0.84 to 1.15 solar masses and surface temperature
of between 5,300 and 6,000 K.[2], Tables VII, VIII. Like other main-sequence stars, a G-type main-sequence star is
converting the element hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion.[permanent dead link][3] The Sun,
the star to which the Earth is gravitationally bound in the Solar System, is an example of a G-type main-sequence
star (G2V type). Each second, the Sun fuses approximately 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium in a process known
as the proton-proton chain (4 hydrogens form 1 helium), converting about 4 million tons of matter to energy.[4][5]
Besides the Sun, other well-known examples of G-type main-sequence stars include Alpha Centauri A, Tau Ceti, and 51
Pegasi.[6][7][8]

The term yellow dwarf is a misnomer, because G-type stars actually range in color from white, for more luminous types
like the Sun, to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous G-type main-sequence stars.[9] The Sun is
in fact white, but it can often appear yellow, orange or red through Earth's atmosphere due to atmospheric Rayleigh
scattering, especially at sunrise and sunset.[10][11][12] In addition, although the term "dwarf" is used to contrast
yellow main-sequence stars with giant stars, yellow dwarfs like the Sun outshine 90% of the stars in the Milky Way
(which are largely much dimmer orange dwarfs, red dwarfs, and white dwarfs, the last being a stellar remnant).

A G-type main-sequence star will fuse hydrogen for approximately 10 billion years, until it is exhausted at the center
of the star. When this happens, the star expands to many times its previous size and becomes a red giant, such as
Aldebaran (or Alpha Tauri).[13] Eventually the red giant sheds its outer layers of gas, which become a planetary
nebula, while the core rapidly cools and contracts into a compact, dense white dwarf.[permanent dead link][3]"
