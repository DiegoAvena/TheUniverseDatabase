"Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a
dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in
the past.

Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam
the alien landscape. Two NASA rovers and one lander are currently exploring the surface of Mars (and a Chinese lander
is set to land later this year). An international fleet of eight orbiters are studying the Red Planet from above.

These robotic explorers have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere,
billions of years ago.

NASA's next-generation Perseverance rover – the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world – touched
down on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey traversing 293 million miles (472 million kilometers).
Confirmation of the successful touchdown was announced in mission control at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
at 3:55 p.m. EST (12:55 p.m. PST).

Perseverance is one of three spacecraft that arrived at Mars in 2021. The Hope orbiter from the United Arab Emirates
arrived on Feb. 9, 2021. China’s Tianwen-1 mission arrived on Feb. 10, 2021, and includes an orbiter, a lander, and a
rover. Europa and India also have spacecraft studying Mars from orbit."
