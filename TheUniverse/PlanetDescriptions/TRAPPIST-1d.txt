"TRAPPIST-1d is one of seven Earth-sized planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. About 40 light-years from Earth, TRAPPIST-1
is unusual both for its number of small rocky planets and the number in the habitable zone. Several of the artist's
illustrations shown above portray possible water or ice in the systemâ€“ the proximity of the planets to their red
dwarf star may indicate that any of them could have water on their surface. This artist's concept shows TRAPPIST-1d
with a narrow band of water near the terminator, the divide between a hot, dry day and an ice-covered night side."
