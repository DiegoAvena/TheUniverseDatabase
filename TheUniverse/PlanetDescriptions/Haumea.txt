"Originally designated 2003 EL61 (and nicknamed Santa by one discovery team), Haumea resides in the Kuiper belt and is
roughly the same size as Pluto. Haumea is one of the fastest rotating large objects in our solar system. Its fast
spin distorts Haumea's shape, making this dwarf planet look like a football."
