Quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_128_b

"Ross 128 b is a confirmed Earth-sized exoplanet, likely rocky, orbiting within the inner habitable zone of the red
dwarf Ross 128, at a distance of about 11 light-years from Earth.[2] The exoplanet was found using a decade's worth
of radial velocity data using the European Southern Observatory's HARPS spectrograph (High Accuracy Radial velocity
Planet Searcher) at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Ross 128 b is the nearest exoplanet around a quiet red dwarf,
and is considered one of the best candidates for habitability. The planet is only 35% more massive than Earth,
receives only 38% more sunlight, and is expected to be a temperature suitable for liquid water to exist on the surface,
if it has an atmosphere.[1]

The planet does not transit its host star, which will make atmospheric characterization very difficult until larger
telescopes like the European Extremely Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope come online.[1]"
