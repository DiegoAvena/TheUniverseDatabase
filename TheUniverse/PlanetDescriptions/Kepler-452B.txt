"Kepler-452b (a planet sometimes quoted to be an Earth 2.0 or Earth's Cousin[3][4] based on its characteristics;
also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-7016.01) is an exoplanet orbiting the Sun-like star
Kepler-452 about 1,402 light-years (430 pc) from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. It was identified by the Kepler
space telescope, and its discovery was announced by NASA on 23 July 2015.[5]

It is the first potentially rocky super-Earth[6] planet discovered orbiting within the habitable zone of a star very
similar to the Sun.[7] The planet is about 1,400 light-years away from the Solar System. At the speed of the New
Horizons spacecraft, about 59,000 km/h (37,000 mph), it would take approximately 26 million years to get there.[8]"
