Quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_1061#Gliese_1061_d

"Gliese 1061 c (also known as GJ 1061 c) is an exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 1061, 12 light years away from
Earth.[12]

Gliese 1061 c is 75% more massive than the Earth, it receives 35% more stellar flux and has an equilibrium temperature
of 275 K (2 째C; 35 째F).[13]

Gliese 1061 c orbits its star every 6.7 days, so it is probably in synchronous rotation with its star.

It is an exoplanet warmer than Earth, with an equilibrium temperature of almost 20 K greater, so the average
temperature on the surface could be around 34 째C (307 K; 93 째F), provided the atmosphere is of similar composition
to the Earth's."
