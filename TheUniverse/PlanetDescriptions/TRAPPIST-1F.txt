Quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1f

"TRAPPIST-1f, also designated as 2MASS J23062928-0502285 f, is an exoplanet, likely rocky but under a massive
water-steam gaseous envelope at very high pressure and temperature,[1] orbiting within the habitable zone[2]
around the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 39 light-years (12 parsecs) away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius.
The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in
front of its star is measured.

It was one of four new exoplanets to be discovered orbiting the star using observations from the Spitzer Space
Telescope.[3]

The planet is an eyeball planet candidate."
