Quoted from: https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/dwarf-planets/makemake/in-depth/#otp_overview

"Along with fellow dwarf planets Pluto, Eris and Haumea, Makemake is located in the Kuiper Belt, a region outside the
orbit of Neptune. Slightly smaller than Pluto, Makemake is the second-brightest object in the Kuiper Belt as seen from
Earth (while Pluto is the brightest). It takes about 305 Earth years for this dwarf planet to make one trip around the
sun.

Makemake holds an important place in the history of solar system studies because it—along with Eris—was one of the
objects whose discovery prompted the International Astronomical Union to reconsider the definition of a planet and to
create the new group of dwarf planets.

Makemake was named after the Rapanui god of fertility."
