Quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_Ceti_f

"Tau Ceti f is a super-Earth[1] or mini-Neptune orbiting Tau Ceti that was discovered in 2012 by statistical analyses
of the star's variations in radial velocity, based on data obtained using HIRES, AAPS, and HARPS. It is of interest
because its orbit places it in Tau Ceti's extended habitable zone,[2][3] but a 2015 study implies that there may not
be a detectable biosignature because it has only been in the temperate zone for less than one billion years.[4]"
