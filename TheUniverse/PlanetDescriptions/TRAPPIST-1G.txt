Quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1g

"TRAPPIST-1g, also designated as 2MASS J23062928-0502285 g, is an exoplanet orbiting around the ultra-cool dwarf star
TRAPPIST-1 39 light-years (12 parsecs) away from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. It was one of four new exoplanets
to be discovered orbiting the star using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope.[4] The exoplanet is within the
optimistic habitable zone of its host star.[5] It was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect
that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured.

The second most distant known planet in its system, TRAPPIST-1g is a planet larger than Earth yet less dense, meaning
it likely hosts some form of water."
