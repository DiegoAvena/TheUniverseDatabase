"The size of Kepler-186f is known to be less than ten percent larger than Earth, but its mass, composition and density
are not known. Previous research suggests that a planet the size of Kepler-186f is likely to be rocky.
Prior to this discovery, the "record holder" for the most "Earth-like" planet went to Kepler-62f, which is 40 percent
larger than the size of Earth and orbits in its star's habitable zone.

Kepler-186f orbits its star once every 130 days and receives one-third the energy that Earth does from the sun,
placing it near the outer edge of the habitable zone. If you could stand on the surface of Kepler-186f, the brightness
of its star at high noon would appear as bright as our sun is about an hour before sunset on Earth.

Kepler-186f resides in the Kepler-186 system about 500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. The system
is also home to four inner planets, seen lined up in orbit around a host star that is half the size and mass of the
sun."
