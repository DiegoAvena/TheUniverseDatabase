Quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1e

"TRAPPIST-1e, also designated as 2MASS J23062928-0502285 e, is a solid, close-to-Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within
the habitable zone around the ultra-cool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 approximately 40 light-years (12 parsecs), or nearly
3.7336Ã—1014 km) away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method,
in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured.

It was one of seven new exoplanets discovered orbiting the star using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope.[4]
Three of the seven (e, f, and g) are in the habitable zone.[5][6] TRAPPIST-1e is similar to Earth's mass, radius,
density, gravity, temperature, and stellar flux.[1][2] It is also confirmed to have a compact atmosphere like the
terrestrial planets in our solar system.[7] In November 2018, researchers determined that of the seven exoplanets in
the multiplanetary system, TRAPPIST-1e is the one with the greatest chance of being an Earth-like ocean planet and the
one most worthy of further study with regard to habitability.[8] According to the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog,
TRAPPIST-1e is one of the most potentially habitable exoplanets discovered so far.[9]"
