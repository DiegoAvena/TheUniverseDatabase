"Wolf 1061c or WL 1061c is an exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Wolf 1061 in the
constellation Ophiuchus, about 13.8 light years from Earth, making it the fifth closest known, potentially habitable,
and confirmed exoplanet to Earth (after Proxima Centauri b, Ross 128 b, Luyten b and Tau Ceti e), yielding interest
from astronomers.[3][4] It is the second planet in order from its host star in a triple planetary system, and has an
orbital period of 17.9 days. Wolf 1061c is classified as a super-Earth exoplanet as its estimated radius is greater
than 1.5 RâŠ•."
