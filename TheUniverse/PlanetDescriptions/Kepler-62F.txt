"Kepler-62f[1][2][4] (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-701.04) is a super-Earth exoplanet
orbiting within the habitable zone of the star Kepler-62, the outermost of five such planets discovered around the
star by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. It is located about 1200 light-years (368 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation
of Lyra.[5]

Kepler-62f orbits its star at a distance of 0.718 AU (107,400,000 km; 66,700,000 mi) from its host star with an
orbital period of roughly 267.3 days, has a mass at least 2.8x times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.41
times that of Earth. It is one of the more promising candidates for potential habitability, as its parent star is a
relatively quiet star, and has less mass than the Sun â€“ thus it can live up to a span of about 30 billion years or
so.[6] Due to its mass, Kepler-62f is likely a terrestrial or ocean-covered planet. However, key components of the
exoplanet still need to be assessed to determine habitability; such as its atmosphere if one exists, since it lies
within the outer part of its host star's habitable zone.[1][7]

The discovery of the exoplanet (along with Kepler-62e) was announced in April 2013 by NASA as part of the Kepler
spacecraft data release.[1] The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a
planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. According to scientists, it is a potential candidate
to search for extraterrestrial life, and was chosen as one of the targets to study by the Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence (SETI) program.[8]"
