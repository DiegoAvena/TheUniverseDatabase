Quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_1061#Gliese_1061_d

"Gliese 1061 d is a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf star Gliese 1061,
12 light-years away.[15][16][10]

The exoplanet is estimated to have a mass of 1.64 Earth masses, an equilibrium temperature of 218 K (−55 °C; −67 °F),
and an orbital period of 13 days.[15][14] Due to Gliese 1061 d's semi-major axis, it is likely that the exoplanet is
tidally locked.

It is an exoplanet colder than Earth, with an equilibrium temperature of 218 K (−55 °C; −67 °F) degrees Celsius, so the
average temperature on the surface could be around 250 K (−23 °C; −10 °F), provided the atmosphere is similar to that
of Earth."
