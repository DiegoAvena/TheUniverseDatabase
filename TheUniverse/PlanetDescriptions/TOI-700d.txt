Quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOI_700_d

"TOI 700 d is an exoplanet, likely rocky, orbiting TOI 700, a red dwarf star 101.4 light-years away in the Dorado
constellation. The exoplanet is the first Earth-sized exoplanet in the habitable zone discovered by the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).[3][4][5] It has been estimated that the planet receives about 86% the energy that
the Earth receives from the Sun.[6] It was discovered in January 2020 by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
(TESS)."
