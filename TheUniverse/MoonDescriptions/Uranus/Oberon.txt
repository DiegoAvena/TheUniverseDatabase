Quoted From: https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/uranus-moons/oberon/in-depth/

"Oberon is the second largest moon of Uranus. Discovered in 1787, little was known about this moon until Voyager 2
passed it during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Oberon is heavily cratered―similar to Umbriel―especially when
compared to three other moons of Uranus: Ariel, Titania and Miranda. Like all of Uranus' large moons, Oberon is
composed of roughly half ice and half rock. Oberon has at least one large mountain that rises about 6 km off the
surface."
