"
Jupiter's moon Io is the most volcanically active world in the Solar System, with hundreds of volcanoes, some erupting
lava fountains dozens of miles (or kilometers) high. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's massive gravity
and the smaller but precisely timed pulls from two neighboring moons that orbit farther from Jupiterâ€”Europa and
Ganymede."
