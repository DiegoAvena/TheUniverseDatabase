"Scientists are almost certain that hidden beneath the icy surface of Europa is a salty-water ocean thought to contain
twice as much water as Earth’s oceans combined.

Europa may be the most promising place in our solar system to find present-day environments suitable for some form
of life beyond Earth.

Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa’s water-ice surface is crisscrossed by long, linear fractures, cracks,
ridges, and bands. The moon’s ice shell is probably 10 to 15 miles (15 to 25 kilometers) thick, beneath which the
ocean is estimated to be 40 to 100 miles (60 to 150 kilometers) deep. Like Earth, Europa is thought to also contain a
rocky mantle and iron core.

Europa is named for a woman who, in Greek mythology, was abducted by the god Zeus — Jupiter in Roman mythology."
