Quoted from: https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/pluto-moons/hydra/in-depth/

"Hydra is the outer of the two moons discovered orbiting Pluto in 2005. Nix and Hydra are roughly 5,000 times fainter
than Pluto and are about two to three times farther from Pluto than its large moon, Charon, which was discovered in
1978. Nix and Hydra are roughly 20 to 70 miles (32 to 113 km) wide.

They are so faint so small and so faint that scientists combined a short exposure of Pluto and Charon and a long
exposure of Nix and Hydra to create images of them all together."
