Quoted from: https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/pluto-moons/charon/in-depth/

"At half the size of Pluto, Charon is the largest of Pluto's moons and the largest known satellite relative to its
parent body. Pluto-Charon is our solar system's only known double planetary system. The same surfaces of Charon and
Pluto always face each other, a phenomenon called mutual tidal locking. Charon orbits Pluto every 6.4 Earth days."
