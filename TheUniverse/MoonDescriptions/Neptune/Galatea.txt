"Galatea is another of Neptune's tiny moons. Small and irregularly-shaped like Despina, Galatea orbits in the same
direction as Neptune and is relatively close to the gas giant's equatorial plane. The small moon's gravity is believed
to cause disturbances in Neptune's ring system. It was found in the same month scientists discovered ring arcs, or
partial rings, that were suspected to exist around Neptune.

Galatea circles Neptune every 10 hours and 18 minutes."
