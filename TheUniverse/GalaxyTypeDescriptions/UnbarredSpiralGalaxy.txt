Quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbarred_spiral_galaxy

"An unbarred spiral galaxy[1][2] is a type of spiral galaxy without a central bar, or one that is not a barred spiral
galaxy. It is designated with an SA in the galaxy morphological classification scheme.

Barless spiral galaxies are one of three general types of spiral galaxies under the de Vaucouleurs system
classification system, the other two being intermediate spiral galaxy and barred spiral galaxy. Under the Hubble tuning
fork, it is one of two general types of spiral galaxy, the other being barred spirals."
