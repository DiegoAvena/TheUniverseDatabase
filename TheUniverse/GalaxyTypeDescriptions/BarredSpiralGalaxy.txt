Quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_spiral_galaxy

"A barred spiral galaxy is a spiral galaxy with a central bar-shaped structure composed of stars.[1] Bars are found in
about half of all spiral galaxies.[2][3] Bars generally affect both the motions of stars and interstellar gas within
spiral galaxies and can affect spiral arms as well.[2] The Milky Way Galaxy, where the Solar System is located, is
classified as a barred spiral galaxy.[4]

Edwin Hubble classified spiral galaxies of this type as "SB" (spiral, barred) in his Hubble sequence and arranged them
into sub-categories based on how open the arms of the spiral are. SBa types feature tightly bound arms, while SBc types
are at the other extreme and have loosely bound arms. SBb-type galaxies lie in between the two. SB0 is a barred
lenticular galaxy. A new type, SBm, was subsequently created to describe somewhat irregular barred spirals, such as
the Magellanic Clouds, which were once classified as irregular galaxies, but have since been found to contain barred
spiral structures. Among other types in Hubble's classifications for the galaxies are the spiral galaxy, elliptical
galaxy and irregular galaxy."
