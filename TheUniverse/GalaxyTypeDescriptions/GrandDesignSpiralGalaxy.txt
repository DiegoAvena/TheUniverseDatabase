Quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_design_spiral_galaxy

"A grand design spiral galaxy is a type of spiral galaxy with prominent and well-defined spiral arms, as opposed to
multi-arm and flocculent spirals which have subtler structural features. The spiral arms of a grand design galaxy
extend clearly around the galaxy through many radians and can be observed over a large fraction of the galaxy's radius.
As of 2002, approximately 10 percent of all currently known spiral galaxies are classified as grand design type
spirals,[1] including M51, M74, M81, M83, and M101."
